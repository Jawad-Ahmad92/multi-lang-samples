#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#why we not used in for loop "i+=1"--> because for take automatically take next value 

   #for example list in for loops

lis=[1,3,4,2,5,6]
print(type(lis))   #output is type od lis -->class 'list'>

for i in lis: #i is used for take one element from lis
    print(i)   #out put is --> 1,3,4,2,5,6
